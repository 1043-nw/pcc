title: Solutions to Exercises
---

The solutions for selected exercises from each chapter can be found below. Be careful about looking at the solutions too quickly; make sure you've given yourself time to wrestle with the concepts you just learned before looking at a solution. Also, there are several ways to solve many of the exercises, and the solutions only show one possible way to complete each exercise.

I haven't included solutions for Chapters 12-14 and 18-20, because the exercises for those chapters are really projects in themselves. If you're having trouble with an exercise from one of those chapters consider posting on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), or [get in touch](#questions).
